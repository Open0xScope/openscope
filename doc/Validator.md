## Run the Validator

1. **Create Configuration File**: Create a file named `config.ini` in the `env/` folder with the following contents:

    ```ini
    [validator]
   name = [Desire Validator Name]
   keyfile = [Your comx key name]
   interval = [Weight Update Frequency (seconds)] #This is recommend to align with the subnet tempo 
   isTestnet = 0 #Whether using commune testnet: 1 means testnet; others means mainnet
    
    [api]
    url = [The trade services url] #For testnet: url = http://47.236.87.93:8000/  mainnet: url = http://8.219.104.233:8000/
    ```

2. Connect to the trade services

Each validator should connect to the trade services to obtain miner trades, this is used for evaluate miner's performance.

Set the [api] url parameters in config.ini file would be enough.

3. Register the validator & Stake

Note that you are required to register the validator first, this is because the validator has to be on the network in order to set weights. You can do this by running the following command:

```
comx module register <name> <your_commune_key> --netuid <OpenScope netuid>
```

OpenScope netuid: 5.

OpenScope Testnet netuid: 14.

You also need to stake on the subnet to be eligible for setting weights, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
comx --testnet balance stake <key-name> <stake amount> <address> --netuid <netuid>
```



4. Serve the validator

```
python src/openscope/validator/validator.py
```

This will start a process that automatically performs all the validator duties.

You can set your own config file by --config your_config_name. The default config file is env/config.ini

Note: you need to keep this process alive, running in the background. 

The successful serve will show the following message:

```

weights for the following uids: [3, 4, 6, 5]
..
```

This shows that your validator is calculating the weights for miners based on the miner's position ROI conversion rule. You can still customize your own weight calculation logic but running the provide services is effortless and keep you aligned with the most validators.

This process will run every config.ini.interval seconds
